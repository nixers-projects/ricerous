# Ricerous - A Ricer Helper

WIP, A Nixers community project

![unit test](https://travis-ci.org/nixers-projects/ricerous.svg)


## The Idea

A kind of portable wiki diary program about ricing. It regroups altogether what
can be riced with useful information and link about it. It also let the user
notes/comments in each sections to keep track of what has been done. The notes
can then be exported/imported in multiple formats. We hope it will:

  * Make it easy to redo another person's setup.
  * Remove the mystification around the word "ricing".
  * Easily share one's setup on forums/boards.

and will be useful to both beginner ricers that don't know where to start and
advanced users that get lost when they want to share info about their setup alike.

## Installation

First, install setuptools. Then, run:

    $ sudo python setup.py install

After that, you can run Ricerous:

    $ ricerous
