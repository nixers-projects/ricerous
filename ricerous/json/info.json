Those are normally fully customizable.\n\nA file manager might also be able to access files over the network.\n\nA bunch files managers included in DE have the ability to manage the \"Desktop\", as in the icon displayed over the root window aka \"background\".\n\n",

        "Terminal emulator": "Terminal emulators are graphical applications sitting between the user and the shell(isn't it a media to interact with the terminal) [ref needed]. Terminal emulators consist of a text input to interact with the shell, and with such there are only a few thing you can tweak: background, text colors, font and behavior.\n\nAs  terminal emulators are graphical windows, you can change their aspect,  starting by the background. \nSome terminals (like gnome-terminal, or  konsole) include drop-down menus to customise most settings. \nIn case of  more minimalist terminals, you'll have to use another way to modify  them. Common means are either by using the X resource database (xrdb),  or by modifying the application at compilation time (by modifying a file  commonly named \"config.h\" or \"config\"). \nIn case of an \"xrdb compliant\" terminal,  you will have to run `xrdb -merge /path/to/file` and relaunching the app  to see your changes applied. For \"config.h style terminals\", a  recompilation and restart of the app is needed. While drop-down menu  like terminals are modified instantly.\n\nHere is a list of commonly used terminals\n\nModified via mouse menus:\n    * gnome-terminal\n    * konsole\n    * terminator\n    * yakuake\n    * xfce-terminal\n\nModified via xrdb\n    * rxvt-unicode\n    * xterm\n    * aterm\n    * mterm\n\nModified via config.h/config\n    * evilvte\n    * st\n    * termite\n\nBackground\nTerminal  backgrounds consists of the rectangular area filling the whole window,  behind the text. Most of the time, the default color is white (or  purple, in ONE. SPECIAL. CASE). Depending on your terminal of choice,  you'll be able to modify the color, transparency or image background.  That's pretty much it. \n\nSpeaking of transparency, one can make a  distinction between true  and fake transparency. \nTrue transparency make your terminal look like a  teinted glass. Move it around and you'll be able to see what's behind  it. It require a composite manager [ref needed] to run in order to work. \nFake transparency is more of a hack: when the window will stop moving,  it will \"copy\" your wallpaper on the background, and apply the ply the  teint your specified to it. So if you place it in front of a window, you  not see the window behind your terminal, but the portion of your  wallpaper behind it.\n\nFont\nYou can use two types of font: \"xft\" or \"bitmap\".\nX  font types (or XFT, for short) are well polished fonts. They are  antialiased, scalable and well designed. They look great, but can be  slow to draw sometimes. That's why bitmap fonts are still used. Those  fonts are pixel based and not scalable. That's why they can be drawn  faster.\nNow it's just a matter of choice. Most terminals support both rendering, so do as you please !\n\nText Colors\nA  terminal usually make use of 8 differents colors: black, red, green,  yellow, blue, magenta, cyan and white. Those 8 colors can come in two  flavor: normal and bold. by default, bold colors are just a more flashy  version of the color. It leaves use with a total of 16 different colors  that we can tweak. This palette of 16 colors is commonly referred to as a  \"terminal colorscheme\". \nTo tweak this, the user (you) can assign each  color an hexadecimal code that will be displayed when the color is used.  Before assigning this code, you must be aware of how many different  colors your terminal can display, and thus, which code you can use.\n\nMost of the time, terminals supports 256 differents colors, that you can find here: http://www.calmar.ws/vim/256-xterm-24bit-rgb-color-chart.html.\n\nBehavior\nThe  behavior of the terminal is an important thing, because it's a central  application on a linux desktop. Its behavior is defined by the features  your terminal gives you. Some are modable via perl scripts, drop-down,  have tabs, can resize font on the fly, can open URIs in your web  browser, etc...\nJust try them all !\n\n",
        "Text editor": "The choices for text editors aren't scarce.\nThe prefered choices for ricers are: EMACS, Sublime, and Vim.\n\nThe customization goes as follow:\n    * Syntax highlighting\n    * Theme (for UI elements arrangement)\n    * Plugins\n\nRessources:\nhttp://www.linux.org/threads/text-editors.4104/g\n\n",

        "Desktop Environment": "A desktop environment is usually a big packages of multiple softwares  that together give the user a working environment, in the sense that  everything you'll ever need comes installed with the DE (Desktop  Environment).\nThe number of softwares that are installed with a desktop environment  varies greatly, some of them installs everyting from the window manager  to the music player passing by the bluetooth manager.\n\nIn the ricing world desktop environments are rarely used because  customizing them turns out into a job of uninstalling what has been  installed and reconfiguring what has been configured for you.\nDE are a great choice if you don't have any time to create your own setup.\nRemember that everything that a DE is just a bunch of programs sticked together. They can still be installed outside of it.\nHere are the most common DE:\n    * Cinnamon\n    * Enlightenment \n    * GNOME\n    * KDE\n    * LXDE\n    * XFCE\n    * MATE\n\nYou can find a bigger list here:\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_X_Window_System_desktop_environments\n\nMore information here:\nhttps://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Desktop_Environment\n\n",
        "GUI": "Many  programs written for GNU/Linux and unix-like OSs have a GUI, or Graphical User Interface.  GUIs for most programs are built around a toolkit called GTK+. GTK+ is a  highly-customizable platform that allows end users to tweak every part  of how a GUI appears. Commonly, end users install GTK themes from the  internet that they like.\n\nIcons  comprise mostly all the small pictures you see while interacting with a  GUI. Icon packs can be found all over the internet, and contribute  highly to an attractive GNU/Linux experience. Some popular icon packs  are:\n    * Numix/Numix Circle\n    * Flattr\n    * Moka \n\nGTK  Themes are the backbone of ricing GUI applications. They are the  difference between a dull, stock GUI, and a sexy one. The method for  changing GTK themes varies by WM. Some WMs (like xfwm4) might even  support their own themes outside of GTK. However, a reliable GTK theme  changer is LXDE's \"LXAppearance\" program. Some GUIs rely on an older,  more liked version of GTK known as GTK2, and some rely on the newer,  less liked, GTK3, and some rely on both. Nonetheless, most theme packs  come with support for both. \n\nSome popular GTK themes are:\n    * Iris\n    * simpliX\n    * Numix\n \nMany,  many themes can be found elsewhere on the internet, and a quick search  for what you're looking for will likely bring up a myriad of nice themes  to pick from.\n\nNext,  we have the most finnicky of all riceable things: fonts. Fonts  (specifically typefaces) comprise everything you read and write on your  computer. For that reason, finding a font you like can be a challenge.  \n\nFonts come in two main styles: bitmap and stroke. \n\nBitmap fonts (the  nixers font style of choice) are made up of pixels that define the shape  of the character. For this reason, they're light on resources and easy  to render, but don't scale well and are often only found in one or two  sizes. \n\nStroke fonts, on the other hand, are made with mathematical  formulas that allow them to scale to hundreds of different sizes. And  within these two categories, there are hundreds of different styles. The  two most common words you'll hear are sans and monospace typefaces.  Sans fonts \n\nMouse cursor (kinda the same as with icons)...\n\n",
        "Information System": "An information system can be a status bar, a panel, a dock, a conky, or a taskbar.\nStatus bar. \n\nA status bar is a simple block of text information that stick to one of your screen side. It's suppose to show information about some things in time.\nhttps://github.com/LemonBoy/bar\nhttps://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Dzen\n\nA panel is similar is similar to a taskbar in the way that it sticks to a side of the screen however it has more things to it. It adds the possibility to manipulate windows (maximize, minimize, etc..). It has widgets which are clickable.\nhttps://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Tint2\n\nA dock is a program that regroups some widgets (like a panel) to make it easierto open up programs. It might have a feature to manipulate windows.\nhttps://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Cairo-Dock\n\nA taskbar is the full-fledge bar. It has all the features of a panel pluts, it has a menu, it manages programs that runs hidden in the background (not daemons but programs that have a hide feature), it manages popup messages from programs (if you want to know more about popups check the nofication system part).\nhttps://aur.archlinux.org/packages/gnome-panel/\nhttps://www.archlinux.org/packages/?name=xfce4-panel\n\nIn the ricing world the customization can be done like so:\n    * Use a custom set of icons\n    * Change the colors\n    * Choose what informations are displayed and write scripts for them\n    * Choose the Geometry (size, position, side of the screen)\n    * Change the fonts\n    * Customized the popups\n\n",
        "Wallpaper": "The wallpaper, aka background, is one of the hardest thing to choose in a setup.\nThe colors must fit with the rest of the theme, it should be coherent.\nRemember that most of the time the wallpaper will have windows on it that will hide some parts of it.\nThe wallpaper should not interfere with your workflow.\n\nThe safest way is to use a non colorful tile or a blurred background.\nIf you don't go for that you need to take extra care and time into choose the perfect wallpaper.\n\nGreat ressources for wallpapers:\nhttp://wallbase.cc\nhttp://simpledesktops.com\n\nSome programs can be used to simply setting the wallpaper instead of hardcoding it into the .xinitrc file.\n    * bgs\n    * esetroot\n    * Feh\n    * habak\n    * hsetroot\n    * Nitrogen\n    * pybgsetter\n    * wallpaperd\n    * xli\n\nNote:  The wallpaper isn't related to the \"icons\" on the desktop. If you want  those you'll need a DE shell or a file manager that does that.\n\n",
        "Window manager": "A window manager (WM) is a program which has the purpose of managing  windows in the graphical environement. Managing windows can range from  decorating them to moving them around the screen. The two main types of window managers are tiling WMs and floating (also known as stacking) WMs. For tiling WMs, the windows in a workspace are arranged by the WM and not the user. Tiling WMs can be either manual or automatic. For manual, the window layout is set by the user, and for automatic, the layout is pre-defined by the WM.\n\nSome popular tiling WMs:\n    * herbstluftwm (manual)\n    * Awesome WM (automatic)\n    * i3 (automatic)\n    * bspwm (manual)\n    * stumpwm (manual)\n\nFloating WMs allow for windows to be moved around freely and stack on top of each other . This way of managing windows is the most used in other proprietary OS like MS Windows and OSX. \n\nHere are some popular floating WMs:\n    * openbox (and all *box WMs) (star bucks lol)\n    * xfwm4\n    * evilwm\n    * 2bwm\n    * cwm    \n\nOther things that might differ across Wms are:\n\nThe way it is Configured. Some WMs provide GUI clients for configurations (all WMs included inside DEs, openbox), text files (i3, awesome, bspwm), scripts (awesome). \n\nThe Border/window decoration(s). Borders can often be customized for different colors, widths, and shapes by the user. The window  decorations are a feature that most often allow for quick  identification and control of a window. A title bar and icons to allow  minimization, maximization, and closing the window are the most common  window decorations.\n\nThe way it handles Keybindings. Some Wms are keyboard driven, meaning that they are designed for quick control. Some other don't even handle keys and let a third party program do the job (for example bspwm).\n\nThe way it manages workspaces.There are many types of workspace, tags,  desktops... (here need to explain it a bit for the dumb user)\nA website with a long list of Wms: http://xwinman.org \n\n\nAlong  with the window manger some other programs can be used along to add  fancy decoration to the windows. Often a compositor manager is used. A  composite manager is a program that is used to render extra shadows,  blurring, and transparency to the windows. Here is a list of well known  composite\n    * Xcompmgr \n    * Compiz \n    * Compton\n    * Cairo Composite Manager\n\n"

On GNU/Linux they  can be found in /usr/share/kbd/console/fonts. You can show the current  font using the `showconsolefont` command and change the font using the  `setfont` command.\n\nThe default TTY colors are white on black. To change them you'll have  to use perl-term-extendedcolor-tty (ttycolor) or just use `echo` with  some special escape characters for colors(set them in your shell).\n\nTo make it easy to multitask in the TTY you'll have to use a terminal  multiplexer, a program that lets you use multiple terminals (emulator)  in the same TTY and (but not inclusive) detach programs from one  terminal to another. Tmux or dtach+dvtm can do this.\n\nThe framebuffer can be used to watch videos and view images in the TTY.
